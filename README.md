## Welcome to Big Chillers Duels!

## All skill levels welcome, but please keep the vibes chill. 

# A couple of considerations:

1. No toxic RDM. Meming is allowed but please keep it respectful.
2. No cheating, this will be an instant perma ban.
3. No politics, hate speech, or harassment in chat. This will be a warning followed by a ban.
4. Have fun, take a breath, and stay silly.
5. Bards are always welcome. Jam space in the works.
